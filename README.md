# Gaussian Process Study in Prevention Science

![](gp.png)

Welcome to my independent study repository where I aim to demystify Gaussian Processes and demonstrate their applications in Prevention Science. This project is all about exploring the depth and breadth of Gaussian Processes, simulating data to comprehend their functioning, and generating practical examples using Julia, Python, and R programming languages.

## Overview

Gaussian Processes are a powerful tool in Machine Learning and Statistics, having immense potential to be used in Prevention Science. This project aims to simplify these complex concepts, providing comprehensive materials to understand and employ Gaussian Processes.

## Software Requirements

This project utilizes:

1. **Julia**: A high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. We'll use this for creating most of our examples.

2. **Python**: A widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.

3. **R**: A perfect software for statistical computing and graphics.

The code is mainly written in the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) IDE, which supports a multitude of programming languages including Julia, Python, and R. You will need VS Code to run most of the project files.

We also use Quarto, a scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. It's an excellent tool for creating beautiful, flexible, and reproducible documents with elements like equations, tables, and plots.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/installation.html)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Gaussian-Process-Study.git
   ```
2. Install Python, R and Julia packages
   ```sh
   (I need to feel)
   ```

## Simulated Data

This project utilizes simulated data to demonstrate the practical implementation of Gaussian Processes in a controlled environment. The data is generated to replicate the complexity and variability of real-world data without involving any privacy concerns or data licensing issues.
